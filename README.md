GNSS allows positioning and navigation of ground and aerial platforms/agets almost everywhere and has been widely used in a large variety of devices and applications.

But, despite developments in hardware technologies and Radio-Frequency (RF) signal processing, GNSS cannot be fully available or reliable in certain environments (e.g. dense forestry, tunnels, urban canyons, etc.) or when RF interference is present (e.g. spoofing or jamming).

Therefore, alternative positioning approaches were studied, including collaborative navigation, where platforms navigating in close vicinity can share position and navigation information (vehicle-to-infrastructure - V2I and vehicle-to-vehicle - V2V communications) and a joint navigation solution can potentially provide better results for all platforms with respect to individual ones.

The CONTEST dataset wants to provide multiple data streams to test <b>collaborative positioning</b> approaches, involving both terrestrial and aerial platforms, and using several sensors, such as Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) transceivers, cameras, LiDARs, GNSS.
